# Public Assets

Place static assets here, including:

- `hero-background.jpg` - The hero section background image (1440x1136px recommended)
- Logo SVG files
- Icons and other images

## Background Image

The hero section expects a background image at `/hero-background.jpg`. You can:
1. Download it from Figma using the MCP server
2. Add your own image with the same filename
3. The component will use a dark gradient fallback if the image is not found
